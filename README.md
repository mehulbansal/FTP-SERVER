## What is File Transfer Protocol?
FTP is a standard communication protocol. There are various other protocols like HTTP which are used to transfer files between computers, but they lack clarity and focus as compared to FTP. Moreover, the systems involved in connection are heterogeneous, i.e. they differ in operating systems, directories, structures, character sets, etc the FTP shields the user from these differences and transfers data efficiently and reliably. FTP can transfer ASCII, EBCDIC, or image files. The ASCII is the default file share format, in this, each character is encoded by NVT ASCII. In ASCII or EBCDIC the destination must be ready to accept files in this mode. The image file format is the default format for transforming binary files.

## How does FTP work?
First, a user logins to an FTP server. <br>
The FTP client interacts with the server upon a request, which is the second step. <br>
With FTP, a user can then upload files on the server. <br>

## How to run the program?
In the project directory find the dist folder. <br>
Go to dist folder and run the ftp-gui.exe file. <br>
Login to ftp server. <br>
Select the file to be uploaded <br>
Click on Submit <br>
If the credentials are correct, the file will be sent to the server. Else, it will show "Wrong credentials". <br>
